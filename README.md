## Yidark chain

## Building the source

Many of the below are the same as or similar to go-ethereum.

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.19 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The Yidark project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command   | Description                                                  |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`geth`** | Main Yidark chain client binary. It is the entry point into the Yidark network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It has the same and more RPC and other interface as go-ethereum and can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Yidark network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`. |
|  `devp2p`  | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain. |
|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details. |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks. |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`). |
| `rlpdump`  | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://eth.wiki/en/fundamentals/rlp)) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`). |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node on mainnet:

- VPS running recent versions of Linux
- IMPORTANT 2 TB of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 250 MB/S throughput, read latency <1ms. (if node is started with snap sync, it will need NVMe SSD)
- 16 cores of CPU and 64 GB of memory (RAM)
- Suggest m5zn.3xlarge instance type on AWS, c2-standard-16 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 5 MB/S

### Steps to Run a Fullnode

#### 1. Download the pre-build binaries

```shell
# Linux
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Yidark/yidark-chain/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth-linux |cut -d\" -f4)
mv geth-linux geth
chmod -v u+x geth

```

#### 2. Download the genesis.json

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yidark/yidark-chain/master/docker/genesis.json
```

#### 4. Start a full node

```shell
./geth --datadir ./node --bootnodes enode://688ff529dea9f4dc8524a24c688cf9bb9dd9ac13f23c2a1eabc71d67b66f5444d646ebf4ae1d5a5857483b861d6e9a0768279cac7664de3bc456fa94bcb6a838@47.242.248.60:0?discport=30301 --networkid 668 --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.api txpool,db,eth,web3,net,personal,admin --port 30303 --http.port 8545 --syncmode=full  --allow-insecure-unlock  --verbosity 3 --http.vhosts=* 

```



### Docker Run a Fullnode

#### 1.  Pull Image

```shell
docker pull xiezhanzhang/yidark-chain:test
```

#### 2. Run miner node

```shell
mkdir -p ~/minerData
docker run -d --name ydk-miner-chain -v ~/minerData:/app/data  -p 8546:8545 yidark/yidark-chain:test "--networkid 668 " privateKey Account   
```

#### Or  node

```shell
mkdir -p ~/data
docker run -d --name ydk-chain -v ~/data:/app/data  -p 8545:8545 yidark/yidark-chain:test "--networkid 668 "

```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Yidark network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

* `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
* `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
* `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
* `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
* `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
* `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
* `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
* `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,txpool,web3`)
* `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
BSC nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**
